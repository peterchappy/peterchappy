### :ocean: I'm Peter Chapman (he/him)

I'm a Software Engineer based out of [Queens](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Queens,+NY) who is rather keen on Typescript, React, and Functional Programming. I enjoy designing systems that enable other developers to build fast while also providing both runtime and compile time guarentees.
