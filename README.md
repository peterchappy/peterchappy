### :ocean: I'm Peter Chapman (he/him)

I'm a Software Engineer based out of [Queens](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Queens,+NY) who is rather keen on Typescript, React, and Functional Programming. I enjoy designing systems that enable other developers to build fast while also providing both runtime and compile time guarentees.

  - A Low-Code Solution that will enable indie card game designers to build digital versions of their game  
  - Combining CSS-in-JS and Atomic design implemented in a typesafe fashion
  - Various talks including such topics as Building Generic Components with React and Typescript, Fun with Advanced Types, and Call Me Maybe: Or how I learned to stop worrying and embrace the Monad
  - Creating a personal website that maybe, one day, I'll be happy with (I probably won't)
  - Tending to my digital garden.
